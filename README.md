# Machine_Learning_Salary_Prediction

## **Introduction**

### **Goal**

The objective of this project is to develop a **predictive model** capable of estimating remuneration for various job positions. By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, the project aims to identify and understand the key factors influencing salary levels. This can provide valuable insights for both employers and employees in the context of market-based pay analytics and salary negotiations.

### **Regression Challenges**

**Regression** is a subset of machine learning algorithms used to predict **continuous values**. Unlike classification, which assigns observations to predefined categories, regression focuses on forecasting numerical values on a continuous scale. Examples of regression applications include predicting real estate prices, sales forecasting, and sports results prediction.

In this project, the regression problem involves predicting the **average salary**, a continuous numerical value. Salary prediction is influenced by multiple factors, including **industry**, **company size**, **location**, **professional experience**, and **job position**, making it a complex but insightful problem to solve.
